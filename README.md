# RspStreamer
UDP Streamer for SDRplay RSP2. This application is useful in operating SDRplay RSP2 SDRs with various decoders from @usa_satcom.

This application requires the x86 version of mir_sdr_api.dll and mir_sdr_api.lib, which is available from the fine folks at SDRplay. 

http://www.sdrplay.com/windl.php

You will need to copy the mir_sdr_api.dll and mir_sdr_api.lib from the SDRplay/API/x86 directory into the same directory as the rspstreamer.exe.
